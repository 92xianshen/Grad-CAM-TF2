Grad-CAM implementation in TF 2.x
==============================

Gradient class activation maps (Grad-CAMs) are a visualization technique for deep learning networks. And this is an implementation in TF 2.x.

Please refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.02391v1.pdf for details and https://github.com/jacobgil/keras-grad-cam for original Keras implementation.
